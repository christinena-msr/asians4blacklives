                <p>The Northwest Community Bail Fund works in Seattle to help pay bail for prisoners who are not able to make bail themselves. In light of the pandemic, making bail is especially important as social distancing is not possible in jails and therefore puts people at greater risk of infection. Their greater goal is continued de-carceration in Seattle and King County.</p>
