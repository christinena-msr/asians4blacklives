                        <p class="subtitle">Presidential Reconstruction (1865-1867)</p>
                        <p>President Andrew Johnson pardoned the South, except for Confederate leaders and wealthy planters. Johnson allowed a Southern government to form, which started passing "Black codes," outlining how to continue using freed Black slaves for labor.
                            The Civil Rights Act of 1866 declared that all people born in the United States were U.S. citizens and had certain inalienable rights. The fourteenth amendment, passed in 1868, gave citizenship to all who were born or naturalized in the United States, giving freed Black people citizenship.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle">Radical/Congressional Reconstruction (1867-1877)</p>
                        <p>The South divided into five military districts, which were controlled by the North. The fifteenth amendment passed in 1870, which allowed citizens the right to vote, regardless of race. Both the
                            North and the South saw an increase in Black representation in office.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="title is-5">Redemption</h2>
                        <p>Redemption saw increased anxiety in the South about economics and states' rights. After being effectively quashed in 1868, the KKK rose again as Northern occupation ended in the South. There was increased destruction of Black property and threatening of Black lives at voting booths. Voter suppression policies arose, included gerrymandering, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and literacy tests. Lynching rates skyrocketed, many lynchings taking place under the guise of protecting white womanhood.</p>

                        <p>W.E.B. DuBois, other Black supporters, and white abolitionists gathered on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls to create a list of demands for ending segregation, discrimination based on race, and assurance of economic equality and opportunity.</p>

                            The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of segregation laws as long as segregated facilities were equal in quality. This decision led to the phrase "separate but equal."</p>
